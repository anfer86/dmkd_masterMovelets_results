# DMKD MasterMovelets - Experimental Results and Source Code

This respository presents the experimental results and source code of the paper titled 'MasterMovelets: Discovering Heterogeneous Movelets for Multiple Aspect Trajectory Classification' submitted to the journal DMKD.

## Datasets

The datasets used in the experiments are [here](datasets/).

## Programs

In directory [datasets](datasets/) we also make available the scripts to run MasterMovelets. These scripts use binary files available in directory [programs](programs/).

## Results

The experimental results for the datasets are available in directory [results](results). We also make available a summary of the results of each dataset:
- Gowalla: [summary.csv](results/gowalla/summary.csv)
- Brightkite: [summary.csv](results/brightkite/summary.csv)
- Foursquare: [summary.csv](results/foursquare/summary.csv)

The directory [scripts](scripts/) contains the scripts to evaluate and compare the classifiers.

## Source Code

The source code of MasterMovelets implemented in Java is available [here](source/dmkd_MasterMovelets.zip).
